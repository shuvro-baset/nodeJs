"# nodeJs" 

* start nodeJs using following command 'npm init'. and press enter again and again. 
* we can also do the same thing using 'npm -y' for shortcut way. 
* install express server 'npm install express --save'
* create a file name 'index.js'
* declare express, app and port number. Write a get method simply just showing a message when run server.
* run the file like as any javascript file. You will see the hello world message from app.get method.
* Right now our server is not showing the updated data if we change anything in the function. We need to stop the server and open server again.
* To avoid this problem I install 'nodemon' by using following command- 'npm install -g nodemon'. Here I use g for install it globally.
